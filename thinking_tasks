Understanding the challenge and planning a solution:

Define a task:
- should be from behavioral economics
-


Define which cognitive constraints are we experimenting on:
- scale introvert to extrovert
- attention span
- working memory size
- short term thinking
- response time



Define an LLM agent:
- parametrised by the above constraints in a uniform distribution


You want to run the task on the LLM agents in a simulation environment

Get the results of their experiment

Performance evaluation of the simulation (maybe compared to human subjects)
